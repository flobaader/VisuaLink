## VisuaLink
A Visualization-App for the Danfoss Link System.

### Goal
The goal of the project is, to display the current energy consumption and the history to motivate the user to save energy.

### Problem
The problem is, that currently the user only gets feedback once a year.

### Solution
If feedback is provided every day and the process of energy saving is gamificated,
the user has a daily challenge to save money & save the environment.

This project was created during the energy efficiency hack 2017.
